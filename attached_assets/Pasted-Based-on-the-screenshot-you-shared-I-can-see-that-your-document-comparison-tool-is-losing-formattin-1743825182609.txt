Based on the screenshot you shared, I can see that your document comparison tool is losing formatting when processing Word documents. Here's an improved prompt to help maintain document formatting:

# Redline Document Comparison Tool - Enhanced Formatting Preservation

## Overview
Create a "Redline" document comparison tool that preserves the original formatting from Word documents including headings, line breaks, spacing, tables, bold, italics, fonts, and other styling elements when displaying differences.

## Requirements
1. Implement robust document parsing that maintains all document formatting:
   - Preserve paragraph styles, headings, and font attributes
   - Maintain tables, lists, and other structured content
   - Retain line spacing, indentation, and margins
   - Support inline formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
   - Preserve font families, sizes, and colors

2. Document comparison with formatting preservation:
   - Compare documents at both content and formatting levels
   - Identify changes in text while maintaining surrounding formatting
   - Detect and highlight formatting-only changes
   - Handle complex document elements (tables, images, footnotes)

3. User interface:
   - Display comparison with full formatting fidelity
   - Use color highlighting that doesn't interfere with original styling
   - Provide side-by-side and unified view options
   - Include a legend explaining the highlighting system

## Technical Implementation
1. Use specialized document processing libraries:
   - For DOCX: Use Mammoth.js with custom preservation options, or docx-wasm for more complete format retention
   - Consider Aspose.Words or GroupDocs.Comparison for comprehensive format preservation
   - If using server-side processing, leverage LibreOffice conversion capabilities

2. Document conversion approach:
   - Convert documents to HTML while preserving CSS styling attributes
   - Use a custom HTML diff algorithm that respects formatting tags
   - Consider embedded style approach rather than inline style replacement
   - Implement custom renderers for complex elements like tables

3. Formatting-aware diff algorithm:
   - Extend traditional diff algorithms to handle formatting metadata
   - Track both content and styling changes separately
   - Implement format-preserving merge capabilities
   - Handle special cases for common formatting patterns

## Code Approach
- Use library-specific configuration options to maximize format retention
- Implement custom post-processing of the HTML output to enhance formatting
- Create specialized renderers for document components like tables and lists
- Use CSS to style the diff highlighting in a way that preserves the original formatting

## Considerations
- Test with complex documents containing various formatting elements
- Ensure the UI gracefully handles large documents without performance issues
- Provide fallback rendering options for unsupported formatting features
- Consider progressive enhancement based on document complexity

This approach will help ensure that your document comparison maintains the rich formatting present in the original Word documents, addressing the issues visible in your screenshot.
