Here’s a clean and structured **Replit Agent Prompt** based on your specs. Let me know if you'd like to tweak terminology, user permissions, or validation rules.

**Replit Agent Prompt:**

Implement a new **"Tasks"** section on the Deal Detail page with the following functionality:

### Core Requirements:

1. **Tasks Section**:
   - Add a “Tasks” section below existing deal content.
   - Display two categories: **Internal Tasks** and **External Tasks**.

2. **Task Model**:
   - Fields:
     - `Name` (string, required)
     - `Description` (string, optional)
     - `Due Date` (date, optional)
     - `Assignee` (varies by task type, required)
     - `Status` (enum: `Open`, `Completed`)

3. **Internal Tasks**:
   - Assignable only to users within the organization.

4. **External Tasks**:
   - Assignee options:
     - The Outside Counsel law firm (general)
     - Any attorneys listed under the Outside Counsel record
     - New ad-hoc assignee (created during task creation or edit)
   - Provide an option to **create a new assignee** (name + email).
   - Once created, these assignees appear in the dropdown for future use.
   - If a custom assignee is no longer attached to any task, **auto-delete** and remove from dropdown list.

5. **Task Creation / Edit UX**:
   - Accessible via “Add Task” and “Edit” buttons in the Tasks section.
   - Assignee field must dynamically update based on task type selection (Internal vs. External).
   - For external tasks, support dropdown with filtering and a “+ New Assignee” option.

6. **Task List Display**:
   - Group and display tasks under “Internal” and “External” headers.
   - Include a toggle/filter to show Open vs. Completed tasks.

Let me know:
- Should task visibility be scoped by user role or permissions?
- Should newly created external assignees be tied to a deal, globally available, or organization-wide?
- Do you want email notifications triggered on assignment or due dates?

Happy to refine this further based on answers.
