   - Pull `Company Display Name` from the linked Company page.  
   - If blank, fall back to the `Company Legal Name`.  
   - `Deal Name` is the `name` field on the deal record.

3. **Change the "Due Date" label to "Closing Date"** throughout.  
   - On the edit screen, include a checkbox labeled **“Committed?”**  
   - If checked, display a **green checkmark icon** (✅) with tooltip “Committed Closing Date” next to the date.  
   - Alternatively, use a badge that says “Committed” with green background and white text.

4. **Below the Company Name**, add a new line labeled **“Lead Investor:”**  
   - On edit screens, default to the company name from global settings (see point 8).

     `Lead Investor: Rogue Capital Ventures / Counsel: Smith & Wilson LLP (Sarah Wilson)`  
     - Pull Outside Counsel data from associated deal record.  
   - If the lead investor is **another firm**, prompt user to enter their outside counsel and display:  
     `Lead Investor: [Firm Name] / Counsel: [Other Counsel Name (Attorney)]`  
   - Then, on the **next line**, always show:  
     `Rogue Capital Ventures Counsel: Smith & Wilson LLP (Sarah Wilson)`

5. **Term Sheet Link:**  
   - Add a field labeled **“Term Sheet”**.  
   - If no file is uploaded, show an **Upload button**.  
   - If uploaded, show the file as a **clickable hyperlink** that opens in a **modal viewer** (support `.pdf` and `.docx`).
